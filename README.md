## To install locally ##

For the front end to function in a meaningful way, you'll need to install the Bakeonomics backend API too.
The backend (see the separte backend source file), but for security the .env file has been omitted from the source 
files as it contains API keys and AWS credentials.  If you need it, please contact me directly:
